  <div style="text-align: justify;">
  Hi, I am currently an intern at <a href="https://www.tencent.com/en-us/">Tencent</a>, <a href="https://www.timistudios.com/#games">Timi Studio Group</a>, focusing on AIGC research exploration. 
  
  I obtained my Master's degree from <a href="https://www.bu.edu/">Boston University</a>, where I was supervised by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8YSC1isAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Janusz Konrad</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=okcbLqoAAAAJ&hl=en">Prof. Brian Kulis</a>. I received my B.Eng. degree with honors from <a href="https://english.yzu.edu.cn/index.htm">Yangzhou University</a>, under the supervision of <a href="https://dnxy.yzu.edu.cn/en/info/1110/1273.htm">Prof. Wei Jiang</a>.
  
  I served as a research assistant at the <a href="https://hku-cg.github.io/">CGVU Lab</a> at The University of Hong Kong, supervised by <a href="https://www.cs.hku.hk/index.php/people/academic-staff/taku">Prof. Taku Komura</a>.

  My research interests lie in Graphics, AIGC, and World Models. I have previously worked on physical simulation, 3D reconstruction, and animation with UE5 and Unity. I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position for Fall 2026.
