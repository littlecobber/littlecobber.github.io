short_bio: |
  I am a graduate with a Master degree from Boston University, where I was supervised by Prof. Janusz Konrad and Prof. Brian Kulis. I received my B.Eng. degree with honors from Yangzhou University, under the supervision of Prof. Wei Jiang.
  
  I am currently conducting research in <a href="https://hku-cg.github.io/">CGVU Lab</a> at The University of Hong Kong, supervised by Prof. Taku Komura.

  My research interests are in Graphics, Reinforcement Learning, Physical Simulation and Robotics. I have previously worked on visual understanding, video generation, 3D reconstruction, animation using UE5 and Unity, and traditional computer vision tasks. I am currently seeking a Ph.D. position for Fall 2025.
